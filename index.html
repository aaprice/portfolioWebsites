          I am a goal oriented, hardworking Cyber Security graduate looking to
          start my career in the private or government sector. I have always
          adapted quickly to new technologies and job assignments. At Augusta
          University, I took 20 years of passion and hobby, and turned it into educational
          experience. My attention to detail and overall drive
          makes me a wonderful candidate for the Cyber Security field.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I am looking to use my skills and experience to excel in the
          Cyber Security world. Please take a moment to examine my site and contact
          me if you so desire.
        </p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I was born here in Augusta, Georgia in 1984 and have lived here for
            most of my life. My mother is from New York, and my Father also grew
            up here. They both instilled in me a passion for learning, technology,
            and independence. One of the most influential things my father ever
            told me was, "Never blindly follow, search out the truth for yourself."
            This has stuck with me throughout many facets of my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            I graduated from Augusta State University (now Augusta University)
            in 2010 with a Masters in Public Administration. I spent the next six
            years in law enforcement, where I eventually worked as a financial
            crimes investigator. In 2016 I transitioned to a stay at home parent
            while also working part time as an ESL teacher.
          </p>

          <p>
            In January 2015, I married my beautiful wife. We met when we both worked
            for the Sheriff's Office and often like to joke with people that we
            "met in jail." I have two wonderful step-children through my marriage
            and one child together with my wife. We all live together in the Evans
            area.
          </p>
        
        <h3>Projects/Continued Education</h3>
        <p>
        I am involved with two side projects/businesses. I co-founded <a href="https://www.augustacybersolutions.org/" target="_blank">Augusta Cyber Solutions, LLC</a> with 
          my wife Andrea. I am also part of <a href="https://www.centaursg.com/" target="_blank">Centaur Security Group</a> as the senior developer. At CSG we have developed
          a distribution of Ubuntu Linux that has security tools to train the next generation of civilians/soldiers who wnat to 
          learn necessary skills for the IT/Cyber world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find value in education, and regularly take new courses through Udemy to increase my knowledge base and skills. 
        </p>
